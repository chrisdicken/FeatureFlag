# Feature Flag Code

Written in JupyterLab using Python 3

Please view code on nbviewer if github can't load the code: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chrisdicken/FeatureFlag/blob/main/FeatureFlag.ipynb

Code includes examples where the Feature Flag is turned on and turned off.

# Implementation

Run python code in any CLI with Launch Darkly libraries installed.

I suggest running code in JupyterLab with the Conda Libraries to maintain comments.

```gh repo clone chrisdicken/FeatureFlag```
