# Feature Flag Code

Written in JupyterLab using Python 3

Please view code on Github: https://github.com/chrisdicken/FeatureFlag/blob/main/FeatureFlag.ipynb

Code includes examples of Feature Flags both on and off. 

# Implementation

Run python code in any CLI with Launch Darkly libraries installed.

I suggest running code in JupyterLab with the Conda Libraries to maintain comments.

```gh repo clone chrisdicken/FeatureFlag```
